Welcome to my data science portfolio. This is where I share personal projects that reflect my interests and passions in data science. Each project is a learning experience, and while they may not be perfect, they are an opportunity for me to explore meaningful ideas and grow by doing. My goal is to apply concepts like **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **visualization** to projects that I find both interesting and impactful.

## üìä Featured Projects

### 1. **DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF A PREDICTION MODEL FOR SURGICAL PREDISPOSITION FOR PATIENT MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHCARE JOURNEYS**
- **Description**:
In this project, I developed a prediction model based on machine learning techniques aimed at optimizing the management of surgical patients. The study focused on addressing                    one of the main issues faced by patients: the lack of knowledge about the necessary actions to adequately prepare for their surgeries.\
The project was carried out in collaboration with a private healthcare provider in Chile and utilized a multiclass classification approach. The model was designed to                            identify surgical patients early and proactively predict the most likely surgery they would undergo. Based on this prediction, a tool was developed to guide patients through                    their surgical journey, providing them with the necessary information to prepare and meet preoperative requirements.\
The implementation of the tool was evaluated in a pilot, which, for various reasons, did not yield the expected results. However, it served as a valuable starting point for                     identifying areas for improvement in the methodologies used.
- **Tools used**: BigQuery, Looker Studio, Python, PowerBI, Scribe.
- **Techniques and models**: PCA, PacMap, Umap, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, MLP, Optuna, Shap Values.
- **Results**:
     - *LightGBM:*
       - Precision Macro: 0.81
       - Recall Macro: 0.79
       - F1-Score Macro: 0.80

### 2. **USING LLMS TO HELP IN PHONE BUYING DECISION (IN PROGRESS)**
- **Description**: In this project, I am using Llama 3.2 to help people who may not necessarily be familiar with technology make the best decision when buying a new phone. The goal is for the chatbot to recommend the best option based on their preferences and phone needs.
- **Tools used**: Llama, Ollama, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Streamlit 
- **Techniques and models**: Llama3.2 
- **Results**: In process
